# Distinguish-Four-Basis-States
 New think I learned from microsoft quantum katas.


 **Input:** Two qubits (stored in an array of length 2) which are guaranteed to be in one of the four basis states ($\ket{00}, \ket{01}, \ket{10} or \ket{11}$).
 
**Output:** 

0 if the qubits were in the $\ket{00}$ state,<br>
1 if they were in the $\ket{01}$ state,<br>
2 if they were in the $\ket{10}$ state,<br>
3 if they were in the $\ket{11}$ state.<br>
